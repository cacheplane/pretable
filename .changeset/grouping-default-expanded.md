Group expansion now defaults to expanded rather than collapsed.

`createLocalRowModel` and `PretableSurface` open groups by default, restoring the behaviour `grid-core` shipped before the incremental row-model migration. Grouping is an interactive act here — a user drags a column into the group panel while reading their rows — and collapsing on drop hid the data they were just looking at.

Pass `initialExpansion` to choose another policy. `{ kind: "through-depth", depth: 0 }` opens only the top level and is the one to reach for when the grouped population is too large to draw at once.

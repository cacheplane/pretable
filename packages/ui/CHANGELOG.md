### Patch Changes

- Fix row grouping selection, focus, clipboard output, and treegrid accessibility, ([#259](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/259))
  including keyboard grouping controls and expansion announcements.

### Patch Changes

- Render grouped rows with a derived group column, aggregate formatting, and the ([#255](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/255))
  ARIA treegrid keyboard model. Grouped grids now expose expandable hierarchy
  rows with themed indentation and keep focus anchored when groups collapse.

- Let header dividers inherit `--pretable-rule` from the grid skin instead of a ([#252](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/252))
  fixed inline color, so they match body gridlines in light and dark themes and
  respond to consumer token overrides.

### Patch Changes

- Fix autosize after an empty first render, header layout, and cell clipping. ([#211](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/211))
  - `setRows` now re-runs autosize against the incoming rows. Fetch-then-render is
    the usual order, so the first pass sees no rows and autosize can only fall
    back to its minimum width — which it then kept for the rest of the grid's
    life. Measured from the original column definitions, since autosize skips any
    column that already carries a width; widths the consumer set are left alone.
  - The header cell's inline style was `display: grid` with `align-items: start`.
    Inline styles beat the skin no matter how it is layered, so this quietly
    overrode `[data-pretable-header-cell]`'s `display: flex; align-items: center`
    in `@pretable/ui`, and stacked any multi-node `renderHeaderCell` into rows
    that overflow the header strip. Now flex/center, matching the skin.
  - The default header rendered the words "Newest", "Oldest", and "Sort" — date
    vocabulary applied to every column, which reads wrong on a name or a number.
    Sorted columns now show a direction glyph (`▲`/`▼`) carrying
    `data-pretable-sort-indicator` for themes to target; unsorted columns show
    none, with `aria-sort` and the button's `aria-label` carrying the state.
    **Consumers asserting on that text will need to update**; `renderHeaderCell`
    still overrides the default entirely.
  - Body cells now set `overflow: hidden`. Cells are absolutely positioned, so a
    value wider than its column used to paint straight over its neighbour. Note
    that a cell is a flex container, where `text-overflow: ellipsis` has no
    effect — for an ellipsis, render the value inside a shrinkable element
    (`min-width: 0`) via the column's `render`.

### Patch Changes

- Add MIT license metadata, repository links, homepage links, and issue tracker ([#104](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/104))
  metadata to the public packages as part of the open-source community health
  pass.

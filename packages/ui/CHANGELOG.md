### Patch Changes

- Give the grid a real surface and elevation vocabulary, and fix three bugs it exposes. ([#288](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/288))

  Pinned body cells and group rows no longer borrow `--pretable-bg-header`; they have
  `--pretable-bg-pinned` and `--pretable-bg-group-row`. Small affordances no longer borrow the card's
  `--pretable-radius`; they have `--pretable-radius-control`, because a 12px card radius renders a
  14px button as a circle. And `--pretable-reorder-ghost-shadow` — four of whose five uses were
  popovers, not drag ghosts — is renamed `--pretable-shadow-overlay`, joined by
  `--pretable-shadow-card` and `--pretable-shadow-seam`.

  Every new token defaults to the value Excel and Material already resolved, so **neither theme
  changes appearance**, verified in a browser across light and dark. The exception is Material's small
  controls, which stop being circles.

  Three fixes. Row hover was declared before the pinned-cell rules and, since every selector in
  `grid.css` is `:where()`-flattened to specificity zero, lost to them — so hovering a row left its
  frozen columns unhighlighted and the row visibly broke in half at the pinned edge.

  Fixing that exposed a worse one. Hover and selection are translucent state layers, and both replaced
  the surface fill rather than tinting it. Pinned cells are `position: sticky` with unpinned columns
  scrolling underneath, so a hovered or selected pinned cell lost its opacity and let the scrolled-under
  column print straight through it — under Excel, whose hover is `transparent`, completely. Both now
  paint into the `background-image` layer and compose over whatever surface colour is beneath, which
  also means hover finally tints a zebra row instead of erasing its stripe.

  Third: Material's dark mode never overrode the shadow token, so every dark-mode menu, popover and
  listbox cast a black shadow onto a near-black surface and nothing read as lifted.

  If you have a custom theme, rename `--pretable-reorder-ghost-shadow` to `--pretable-shadow-overlay`
  and add `--pretable-bg-pinned`, `--pretable-bg-group-row`, `--pretable-radius-control`,
  `--pretable-shadow-card` and `--pretable-shadow-seam`. Aliasing the two surface tokens to
  `--pretable-bg-header` reproduces the old appearance exactly.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Add server-authority primitives (experimental). ([#286](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/286))

  An upstream processor — a server, a worker, a wasm index — can now own
  filtering and sorting while Pretable renders honest counts and an honest data
  lifecycle.

  - `processing: { filter, sort }` on `createGrid` / `PretableSurface` selects
    per-operation processing authority. `"external"` displays the state (funnel
    indicators, header arrows, `snapshot.filters`, `snapshot.sort`) without
    applying it to the loaded records.
  - `setRows(rows, meta)` and `setResultMeta(meta)` accept a `PretableResultMeta`
    of `{ total, datasetKey }`. `snapshot.matchingTotal` reports the matching
    population; a changed `datasetKey` clears selection, focus, group expansion
    and any in-flight edit.
  - `dataState` (no default) turns on lifecycle presentation: loading / empty /
    error body blocks, a `data-pretable-data-phase` styling hook, and result and
    error announcements. `renderBodyState` overrides the built-in blocks.
  - `aria-rowcount` publishes the exact population under full external authority
    with an exact total and no grouping, and downgrades honestly otherwise.
    `aria-busy` is never set on the grid.
  - Select-all, copy, group child counts and `formatAggregate` are scoped
    `"all" | "loaded"` so a partial window can never be described as everything.
  - `column.filterOperators` prunes the funnel menu to operators the processor
    can honor.

  **Breaking:** `PretableGridSnapshot.totalRowCount` and
  `PretableTelemetry.totalRowCount` are renamed to `loadedRowCount`. There is no
  alias — the old name became wrong the moment two totals existed.

  **Also breaking:** four of the new members are required, not optional, so any
  hand-built object of these types stops compiling until it supplies them —
  `matchingTotal` and `datasetKey` on `PretableGridSnapshot`, `matchingTotal` on
  `PretableTelemetry`, and `scope` on `PretableAggregateFormatInput`. Code that
  only reads these types is unaffected.

### Patch Changes

- Split the grid's line vocabulary and give numeric columns real alignment. ([#269](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/269))

  `--pretable-rule` previously coloured both the horizontal row hairline and the
  vertical column divider, so no theme could drop the vertical gridlines without
  also losing row separation. Two new tokens, `--pretable-rule-vertical` and
  `--pretable-rule-width`, split the axes. Both shipped themes alias the vertical
  token back to `--pretable-rule`, so Excel and Material render unchanged.

  Columns now carry an optional `align` (`"start" | "center" | "end"`), and the
  surface emits `data-pretable-column-type` and `data-pretable-column-align`.
  Number columns default to trailing alignment with tabular, lining figures — in
  the grid's own font, not a monospace substitute. Alignment uses
  `justify-content: safe flex-end`; the `safe` keyword matters, because a plain
  trailing alignment clips an over-wide value at its leading edge, which would
  render `1,234,567` as a legible and completely wrong `34,567`.

  Fixes a bug where header cells, which render as `<button>`, never reset the
  user-agent button background — so the grid only looked correct in apps that
  happen to ship a CSS reset.

  Removes three declarations that never painted: the `[data-pretable-numeric]`
  rule, which nothing has ever emitted despite `@pretable/ui`'s README advertising
  it as part of the public attribute contract; the `[data-pretable-toolbar]` and
  `[data-pretable-status-bar]` rules, which no component can emit; and the
  selection rule's `background`, which could never win against the `aria-selected`
  rule that follows it at equal specificity. The selection rule keeps its `color`,
  which is load-bearing.

### Patch Changes

- Fix row grouping selection, focus, clipboard output, and treegrid accessibility, ([#259](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/259))
  including keyboard grouping controls and expansion announcements.

## 0.0.8

## 0.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Render grouped rows with a derived group column, aggregate formatting, and the ([#255](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/255))
  ARIA treegrid keyboard model. Grouped grids now expose expandable hierarchy
  rows with themed indentation and keep focus anchored when groups collapse.

- Let header dividers inherit `--pretable-rule` from the grid skin instead of a ([#252](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/252))
  fixed inline color, so they match body gridlines in light and dark themes and
  respond to consumer token overrides.

## 0.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Fix autosize after an empty first render, header layout, and cell clipping. ([#211](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/211))
  - `setRows` now re-runs autosize against the incoming rows. Fetch-then-render is
    the usual order, so the first pass sees no rows and autosize can only fall
    back to its minimum width — which it then kept for the rest of the grid's
    life. Measured from the original column definitions, since autosize skips any
    column that already carries a width; widths the consumer set are left alone.
  - The header cell's inline style was `display: grid` with `align-items: start`.
    Inline styles beat the skin no matter how it is layered, so this quietly
    overrode `[data-pretable-header-cell]`'s `display: flex; align-items: center`
    in `@pretable/ui`, and stacked any multi-node `renderHeaderCell` into rows
    that overflow the header strip. Now flex/center, matching the skin.
  - The default header rendered the words "Newest", "Oldest", and "Sort" — date
    vocabulary applied to every column, which reads wrong on a name or a number.
    Sorted columns now show a direction glyph (`▲`/`▼`) carrying
    `data-pretable-sort-indicator` for themes to target; unsorted columns show
    none, with `aria-sort` and the button's `aria-label` carrying the state.
    **Consumers asserting on that text will need to update**; `renderHeaderCell`
    still overrides the default entirely.
  - Body cells now set `overflow: hidden`. Cells are absolutely positioned, so a
    value wider than its column used to paint straight over its neighbour. Note
    that a cell is a flex container, where `text-overflow: ellipsis` has no
    effect — for an ellipsis, render the value inside a shrinkable element
    (`min-width: 0`) via the column's `render`.

### Patch Changes

- Add MIT license metadata, repository links, homepage links, and issue tracker ([#104](https://github.com/cacheplane/pretable/pull/104))
  metadata to the public packages as part of the open-source community health
  pass.
